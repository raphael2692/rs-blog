We will use the LangChain library to connect these different functionalities.
Required Libraries We will be using the following external libraries:
loguru trafilatura openai langchain Before we dive deeper, ensure that all these libraries are installed in your system.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.raffaelespataro.it/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.raffaelespataro.it/about/</guid><description>Hey there! 👋 I&amp;rsquo;m Raffaele - a software developer based in Rome, Italy.
I started my career as a data scientist and eventually also learned how to code and deploy web applications.
These days I&amp;rsquo;m a line manager for a software consultancy agency in Rome, where I work on all kinds of cool web and data applications with my team.
That&amp;#39;s me! I mostly use Python for my projects, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also dabbled in Angular for frontend development.</description></item></channel></rss>
