Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raffaele - a software developer based in Rome, Italy. 

I started my career as a data scientist and eventually also learned how to code and deploy web applications. 

These days I'm a line manager for a software consultancy agency in Rome, where I work on all kinds of cool web and data applications with my team.

I mostly use Python for my projects, but I've also dabbled in Angular for frontend development.

When I'm not working, I love to share my passion for coding with others on this blog. I write about everything from technology to my daily life (and everything in between). 

If you want to see some of my work, check out my [my GitHub](https://github.com/raphael2692). 

Anyway, thanks for stopping by my blog! I hope you find something useful here. And if you ever want to chat about coding (or anything else), feel free to reach out!
